## OBJECTIVE
---

I have decided to carry out this visualization project following my [previous hotel data analysis project](https://github.com/Belengasset/Project_Jan22_Hotels). 
The former project consisted in evaluating if the ranking proposed by Travel+ Leisure magazine was in line with what Tripadvisor and Google reviews users thought.

This time the project goes further, from the databases of the hotels of the previous project together with a database of restaurants of the Michelin Guide, I propose you three possibilities in which you can travel according to your preferences. First you can choose where you want to travel and I will propose you the best hotel, in the same way the best restaurant of the michelin guide. Finally I will propose you a complete experience, combining the best hotel and restaurant of the country of your choice.
